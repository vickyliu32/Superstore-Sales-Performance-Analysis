The aim is to evaluate the sales performances by region and product category, to find out the profitable and deficit products. 



Findlings: 



Profits by region
West and East region perform better 
Central region, Texas and Illinois indicates serious deficit  
South region, North Carolina and Tennessee struggle in deficit 

Profits by category
Technology category achieve the greatest profits than Furniture and Office suppliers
Copiers, phones, accessories make a very positive profit performance 

Recommendation: 
Tables and bookcase are not profitable, may consider cut the product line or adjust the promotion strategy 
Increase technology category products types and invest more resources in order to maintain the highest profit in the company 
Central's Texas sales performances, try to reconsider the serious deficit products category, such as furnishings, tables and appliances
